## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v1.1.2 to v1.2.0

**Major Feature Update**: This release adds 9 new linting rules. Existing configurations remain fully compatible, but you may encounter new rule violations in your codebase.

**Recommended Migration Strategy**:

**Step 1: Update Version**
```yaml
# Update version in your workflow
- name: Terraform Scripts Lint
  uses: Lance52259/hcbp-scripts-lint@v1.2.0  # Updated from v1.1.2
  with:
    # All existing parameters remain the same
    changed-files-only: 'true'
    base-ref: 'origin/main'
```

**Step 2: Gradual Rule Adoption (Recommended)**
```yaml
# Temporarily ignore new rules during transition
- name: Terraform Scripts Lint
  uses: Lance52259/hcbp-scripts-lint@v1.2.0
  with:
    # Ignore new rules initially
    ignore-rules: 'ST.004,ST.005,ST.006,ST.007,ST.008,ST.009,IO.006,IO.007,IO.008'
    # ... other existing parameters
```

**Step 3: Enable Rules Progressively**
```yaml
# Phase 1: Enable documentation rules first (easier to fix)
ignore-rules: 'ST.004,ST.005,ST.006,ST.007,ST.008,ST.009'

# Phase 2: Enable spacing rules
ignore-rules: 'ST.004,ST.005,ST.009'

# Phase 3: Enable indentation rules
ignore-rules: 'ST.009'

# Phase 4: Enable all rules (full compliance)
# Remove ignore-rules parameter
```

**Common Migration Tasks**:
- **Add Variable Descriptions**: Update `variables.tf` with description fields for IO.006
- **Add Output Descriptions**: Update `outputs.tf` with description fields for IO.007
- **Add Variable Types**: Ensure all variables have type definitions for IO.008
- **Fix Indentation**: Convert tabs to spaces and ensure 2-space indentation for ST.004/ST.005
- **Adjust Spacing**: Add proper spacing between resource blocks for ST.006/ST.007/ST.008
- **Reorder Variables**: Align variable definition order with usage order for ST.009

**No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality remains unchanged.
