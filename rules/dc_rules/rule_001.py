DC.001 - Comment Format Validation Rule

This module implements the DC.001 rule which validates comment formatting
in Terraform files. The rule ensures that all comments follow consistent
formatting standards for better code readability and maintainability.

Rule Specifications:
- All comments must start with the '#' character
- There must be exactly one space between '#' and the comment text
- Empty comments (only '#') are allowed and considered valid
- Multiple spaces or tabs after '#' are considered violations
- Comments within string literals are not validated (Terraform-specific)
- Comments within HCL heredoc blocks (<<EOT, <<EOF, etc.) are excluded from validation

Valid Examples:
    # This is a properly formatted comment
    # TODO: Add validation logic
    # Variable description for input parameters
    #

Invalid Examples:
    // This comment uses wrong format
    #This comment has no space after #
    #  This comment has multiple spaces after #
    #	This comment has a tab after #

HCL Heredoc Example (comments inside are excluded):
    locals = <<EOT
    #! /bin/bash
    echo "hello world!"
    EOT

    """
    Validate comment formatting according to DC.001 rule specifications.

    This function scans through all lines in the provided Terraform file content
    and validates that comments follow the proper formatting standards. It checks
    for the presence of exactly one space after the '#' character and reports
    violations through the provided error logging function.

    The validation process includes:
    1. Line-by-line analysis of file content
    2. Comment pattern identification using regex
    3. Spacing validation after '#' character
    4. Error reporting with specific line numbers and messages
    5. Handling of edge cases (empty comments, string literals)
    6. Exclusion of comments within HCL heredoc blocks

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the file being checked. Used for error reporting
                        to help developers identify the location of violations.
        content (str): The complete content of the Terraform file as a string.
                      This includes all lines, comments, and code blocks.
        log_error_func (Callable[[str, str, str, Optional[int]], None]): A callback function used
                      to report rule violations. The function should accept four
                      parameters: file_path, rule_id, error_message, and line_number.
                      The line_number parameter is optional and can be None.

    Returns:
        None: This function doesn't return a value but reports errors through
              the log_error_func callback.

    Raises:
        No exceptions are raised by this function. All errors are handled
        gracefully and reported through the logging mechanism.

    Example:
        >>> def mock_logger(path, rule, msg, line_number):
        ...     print(f"{rule}: {msg} (line {line_number})")
        >>> content = "# Good comment\\n#Bad comment\\n#  Multiple spaces"
        >>> check_dc001_comment_format("test.tf", content, mock_logger)
        DC.001: Comment should have one space after '#' character (line 2)
        DC.001: Comment should have exactly one space after '#' character (line 3)

    Note:
        This function focuses on comment formatting within Terraform files and
        excludes comments within HCL heredoc blocks (<<EOT, <<EOF, etc.) to avoid
        false positives when validating embedded scripts or configuration files.
